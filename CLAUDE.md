# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Structure

This is a full-stack application with a Python backend and Next.js frontend:

- `backend/` - Python application with minimal setup (requires Python >=3.13)
- `frontend/` - Next.js 15 application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React 19

## Development Commands

### Frontend (Next.js)
Navigate to `frontend/` directory for all frontend operations:
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (runs on http://localhost:3000)
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Backend (Flask)
Navigate to `backend/` directory for backend operations:
- `python main.py` - Run the Flask backend server (runs on http://localhost:5001)
- `uv add <package>` - Add new Python dependencies
- Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable

## Architecture Notes

- Frontend uses Next.js App Router with TypeScript and D3.js for graph visualization
- Main page component is at `frontend/app/page.tsx`
- Backend is a Flask API with Claude integration for generating subtopics and summarizing conversations
- Key API endpoints: `/api/generate-subtopics` and `/api/summarize-conversation`
- Interactive learning graph with force-directed layout using D3.js
- Components: InterestInput, LearningGraph, ContextMenu
- Frontend includes Tailwind CSS for styling and TypeScript for type safety

## Project Summary

LearnLoop is a website that turns you into a lifelong learner. It does this by both suggesting new things for you to learn and helping you keep track of what you've already learnedâ€”it closes the learning loop.

For a new user, the flow looks like this:
1. Enter your general interests (giving them suggestions of "popular interests", like AI or biochemistry or astronomy).
2. A graph is created, where each interest is a separate node.

Then:
1. The user can double click on a node to "expand" on it.
	- This creates new nodes that are "subtopics" that branch off of it. (These are generated using AI, and only around 3 (random) subtopics should be generated when this occurs; the user can double-click again to generate more.)
2. The user can right click on a node to get the following options:
	- Start a voice conversation with the AI about the topic.
		- This should be like an interactive podcast; by default, the AI just talks about the topic in a teaching manner, but the user can jump in at any point to ask a question or ask to talk about something else.
		- At the end, this should add to / create notes and create more nodes if desired (for example, if the user decides to talk about AI and ends up talking a lot about LLMs, then a node for LLMs should be made and connected to the AI one).
	- View the notes generated by voice conversations.
	- Indicate that they're not interested in a topic (which deletes the node from the graph).
3. The user can use an AI agent that uses GPT-4.1-mini along with Dex's MCP server to find recent news and developments on the topics they're interested in.
